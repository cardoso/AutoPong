 ## So, what is it about?
 Computer controlled players (aka Bots) are an amazing way that video game developers have found to make it possible for you to play multiplayer games when you are by yourself üòÅ

 This playground will walk you through the process of creating bots for a feature-packed version of the cultural phenomenon "Pong".
 
 ## Quit the explaining, show me some action!
 Sure! Hit **Run My Code** to see what you've got. */
