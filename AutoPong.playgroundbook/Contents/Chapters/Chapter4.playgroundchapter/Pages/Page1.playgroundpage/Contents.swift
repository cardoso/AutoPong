 > Since this uses SpriteKit and the standard APIs provided by Apple, there are a bunch of things you can do other than what has been suggested so far.
 
 1. Make one or more of the paddles User Controlled instead of AI controlled
 2. Add some randomness to the AI
 3. Track the scores! (See the documentation)
 4. Add more gameplay elements. Make a complete game! :)
